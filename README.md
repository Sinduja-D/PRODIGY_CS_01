The Caesar Cipher is an ancient encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext message is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
For example, with a shift of 1, ‘A’ becomes ‘B’, ‘B’ becomes ‘C’, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his officials.
While it’s easy to implement, it’s not secure against modern decryption methods and has limited possible keys.
